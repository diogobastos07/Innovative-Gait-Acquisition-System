# Innovative-Gait-Acquisition-System
This repository implements an innovative gait acquisition system with a Sequence Quality Analysis Module (SQAM) that captures high-quality gait sequences and calculates displacement angles relative to the camera. Developed to optimize gait acquisition for biometric recognition in monitoring, security, and access control scenarios.
