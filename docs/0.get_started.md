# Get Started
## Installation
1. clone this repo.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/diogobastos07/Innovative-Gait-Acquisition-System.git
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    - ultralytics >= 8.3.0
    - opencv-python

    Install dependencies by pip (recommended):
    ```
    pip install ultralytics
    pip install opencv-python
    ```
    Or, install dependencies by [Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html):
    See [Ultralytics YOLO Documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/pt/quickstart/)

    **Note:**
    The [environment.yaml](../environment.yaml) file in this repository includes all dependencies and versions used for this project. It can be referred to for detailed environment configurations.


## Workflow Overview
To set up and run the Innovative Gait Acquisition System, follow these steps in order:

1. **Prepare the Dataset (CrowdHuman)**  
   Format and preprocess the CrowdHuman dataset to make it suitable for object detection training.  
   See [Prepare Dataset](1.prepare_dataset.md).

2. **Train and Evaluate the Object Detector (YOLO11)**  
   Use the prepared dataset to train and evaluate the YOLO11 object detector for identifying individuals in the scene.  
   See [Prepare Object Detector](2.prepare_object_detector.md).

3. **Integrate Tracking and Sequence Quality Analysis Module (SQAM)**  
   Combine the object detector with the tracking system and SQAM to perform gait analysis and sequence filtering.  
   See [Prepare Acquisition System](3.prepare_acquisition_system.md).
